# Will Open AI interfaces specifically, ChatGPT, render aspects of education uselss? 
In this document, I'm analyzing the two opposite stances in regards to the open AI interface ChatGPT. I will be using two supporting articles to center this discussion of whether or not Chat GPT is a viable database that will be able to restructure aspects of education specifically in areas that require creativity and essay writing.  

## Article 1
In the first article, titled [ChatGPT Is Dumber Than You Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-writing-ethics/672386/) by _The Atlantic_, the author Ian Bogost's central arguement is that ChatGPT is merely: 
>"an apparatus that structures human experience through a very particular, extremely powerful method of symbol manipulation."   

Essentially, ChatGPT will never undermine and render creativity and actual human thought useless, instead it merely serves as a database that complies information together and ejects it out systematically, following a specific format and "extremely uninteresting as prose". For example in regards to essay writing, through his numerous trials, Ian Bogost found that although ChatGPT was able to comply information in a collective, cohesive thought, the actual substance of the essays in response to the given prompt were extremely systematic and standardized- essentially following the five paragraph standard essay format and lacking genuine creativity

## Article 2 
Contrary to the first article, many people are arguing that ChatGPT is powerful enough to be considered "a revolution leader" and is powerful enough to restructure essay writing. Titled [ChatGPT and I Wrote this article](https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/op-ed/chatgpt-and-i-wrote-this-article) author Batuhan Takis argues that the Open AI interface is more than just a database, rather its technological capabilities are sufficient enough and has the potential to cause significant changes to the publishing industry including job displacement. In his article, he goes on to detail how ChatGPT was able to write a "whole article in around 30 seconds- the time it took him to open a Word document and started thinking about the articleâ€™s framework and logic".   

Batuhan Takis then goes on to emphasize the fact that because ChatGPT is able to improve and make adjustments to accomodate different writing styles given the requests you specify it to write in, its capabilities are a huge asset to "showcases the potential of human and language model cooperation in the publishing industry."
